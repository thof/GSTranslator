GSTranslator is simple translator for Gnome 3.

Translations are provided using several dictionaries/translators like:
- Google Translate (support most languages),
- OneLook Dictionary,
- SJP (Polish Dictionary).

GSTranslator works in two modes:
1. Normal window which acts similarly to other regular translators.
2. In the second mode it uses new notification mechanism introduced to Gnome 3. This is a convenient way to get translations of 
currently selected text. Notification with translation appeared in response to a hotkey calling corresponding event.
