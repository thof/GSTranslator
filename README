GSTranslator 0.3.1 - is a simple translator for Gnome 3.
==================

DESCRIPTION
============
Translations are provided using several dictionaries/translators like:
- Google Translate (almost all languages are supported, although I tested only a few European languages),
- OneLook Dictionary,
- SJP (Polish Dictionary).

GSTranslator works in two modes:
1. Normal window which acts similarly to other regular translators.
2. In the second mode it uses new notification mechanism introduced to Gnome 3. This is a convenient way to get translations of currently selected text. Notification with translation appear in response to a hotkey calling corresponding event.

FAQ
===
Q1. You said that GSTranslator support almost all languages, but I can't find my native language?
A1. By default, most of them are hidden. First of all check Properties (Edit -> Properties) and delete it from second list.

Q2. I would like to set a keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+8 to switch favorites, but entry <Ctrl><Shift>8 doesn't work. Why?
A2. GSTranslator doesn't come with user-friendly wrapper to keybinder library. You have to know that Left Alt and both Ctrl behave differently than Right Alt or Shift.
"Ctrl + 8" gives us combination, but "Shift + 8" results in new symbol "asterisk". So appropriate combination will be <Ctrl>asterisk.
Using xev is the easiest way to get specified symbol:
[code]
$ xev | grep -A2 --line-buffered '^KeyRelease' | sed -n '/keycode /s/^.*keycode \([0-9]*\).* (.*, \(.*\)).*$/\1 \2/p'
[/code]
